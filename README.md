The ChefAI is a program where I combined concepts like "bag of words", "stemming" and "tokenization". Also, I used Tkinter for a friendly visual approach. 
P.S. The code works fine without Tkinter, just run main.py, instead of app.py.

WHAT IT DOES:
The project is a simple AI chatbot where you ask him for a recipe, and he gives one with the ingredients.

P.S. i did not add the venv file. 

Here is a list of what you need to install:
1. Numpy
2. Nltk
3. Torch
